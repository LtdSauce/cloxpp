## About cloxpp

This is yet another implementation of the lox language written in C++. 
This project is initially developed while working my way 
through the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book. And its name is not very imaginative.

Because the project itself was bootstrapped from the [cpp_boilerplate_project](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cpp_boilerplate_project) 
template there are maybe some leftovers that I did not clean up.

## Current State Of Journey

Currently, there is nothing implemented at all...
